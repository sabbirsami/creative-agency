                                    A React application may be made more
                                    efficient in a variety of ways. As an

                                    components to avoid unwanted re-renders is
                                    also a good strategy. In addition, dynamic
                                    imports in React allow for code-splitting

                                    The four major forms of state you need to
                                    keep track of in your React projects are
                                    Local state, Global state, Server state, and
                                    URL state. A component's local state refers
                                    to the data it keeps. Managing local state
                                    in React is often accomplished via the usage
                                    of the useState hook. Additionally, for both
                                    local and global states, useReducer is an
                                    option that may be implemented in any way.
                                    Under the hood, it is quite similar to
                                    useState, except that it takes a reducer
                                    instead of a starting state. You'd need a
                                    local state for things like showing or
                                    hiding a modal component and keeping track
                                    of input data for forms that have been
                                    disabled. Data that is shared across
                                    different components is referred to as a
                                    global state. When data has to be accessed
                                    and updated across many parts of our
                                    program, we need to use a global state.
                                    Authenticated user state is a frequent
                                    example of a global state. To get or update
                                    data from an external server, you must
                                    handle a variety of states, including
                                    loading and error state.
